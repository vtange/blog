Hello, world! This will be (what I think) my late start to the blogging world. Do all blogs start this way? I don't know, but I'd rather just take the time to write this than to go over the many blogs I do follow and check what their last page looks like. I might end up not writing often, so a blog post introducing myself couldn't be a bad idea in my opinion.

I'm a guy who likes shaping the world around him. I don't know why but as kid seeing things like Lego blocks, train sets, SimCity, etc. just blew my mind. I loved anything that involved visualizing things from a top-down perspective where you could see a lot of things at once and play with them.

This, coupled with a few other developments in my youth and wild ideas, led me to majoring in Architecture for college. Sometimes I regret this decision, sometimes I make sense of it. More on this in another post.

You know the saying that your first four years of college are the years where you "discover yourself" and all that fancy talk? Well, this ringed very true in my case, and after a few twists, turns, sudden realizations, and big decisions, here I am, building myself up as a web developer, having built and deployed this blog just yesterday and writing this post.

Long story short, I realized that I wanted to build more than just buildings with my life, and I had dreams that were unachievable if I became an architect. I've always had hobbies revolving around computers and figured, "What the hell am I doing here in architecture land when I naturally spend so much more time and energy elsewhere?" Making the sharp turn in career hasn't been comfortable at all, but it's not uncomfortable either: I've already been a computer guy by background anyways, so that helped.

If there's any takeaway from this post, I guess it's to continously monitor yourself and compare what you think you'll become with what you're really becoming. I mean really examine yourself, do you think what you do everyday will help you achieve your goals and dreams? If not, plot a different course. It's like steering a ship out at open sea with the intent of landing on a tiny island with treasure. Except the ship doesn't turn very well - turn early and you won't have to turn too much at once, turn too late and things are going to hurt. If you find yourself moving in a completely bad direction, prepare to be turning slowly for a long time, or turn fast and get things over with.

Too many people never turn and let their dreams pass by in the far distance. Don't be one of them.
