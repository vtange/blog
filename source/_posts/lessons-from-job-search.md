1. AngelList Jobs doesn't really work.



2. Don't bother with recruiter sites like Dice, ZipRecruiter etc.

They are simply not worth what you get back in return. During my months wandering the job market, only one legitimate recruiter contacted me by phone, telling me he found me at Dice. The rest was irrelevant 'spam' jobs requiring many years of experience and relocation. And unless you can convice whoever contacts you via these sites that you're excited and are totally ready to do everything that is asked, you won't even make it past an initial email or interview.

In the long run, these will be a pain to manage, you've already got a portfolio, Github, Stack Overflow, LinkedIn, and other social media profiles to manage, why add more?

3. Freelance is a race to the bottom that will demand time better spent learning new skills.



4. Do not apply to Companies you don't like.

I once went to a Job Fair which effectively had zero companies that interested me. I ended up handing my resume to a company there to make it feel like I didn't drive all the way to the other side of town for nothing. 

I didn't even really like the company. Their site reeked of clunky engineering, their pitch included a totally broken and choppy video, and they openly told me they outsourced their web engineers to cut down on costs.




5. Build unique stuff.

Sites like FreeCodeCamp and the various tutorials you can find online are great, but they come with the inherent cost of 'ubiquity'. Anyone who visits them can with minimal effort build a Tic-Tac-Toe game or API-getter webpage. You cannot stand out if your portfolio consists of projects everyone else has.

Do not put in minimal effort. Make every project count by designing them well and adding a few twists or features. Make your own darn projects, too! I can comfortably say it was my own projects that proved to be better interview-fodder than the stuff I did at code camp.
