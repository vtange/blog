So for whatever reason, you've decided that you want to make the cool things on the internet everyone loves surfing through and using so much. You want to become a web developer. Front end or back end? Doesn't matter. Don't know where to start?

Step One: Learn Github

It shouldn't take a lot of common sense and/or practice with code to learn that code is very picky. One typo? One missing curly brace? Forgot to increment something in a loop? Code breaks. It is very easy to get discouraged from building anything bigger than a simple algorithm or simple web page if you don't feel in control of your code. Without building anything complex, you're pretty much dead in the water as a new developer.

Normally, you type code in a text editor and once you hit save and/or close the editor, CTRL-Z won't help you if your code breaks. That and you probably won't remember what line you changed yesterday or x-hours ago. Makes you kinda paranoid, no?

Github helps you by giving you full control over the history of your code. After you install git, you essentually have a system with which you can "magically" go back to old versions of your code at any time you want without losing your work. Think of it as video game save-files for your code.

You should start by getting a Github account and installing git bash. After that, make a new repository online and 'git clone' it anywhere in your computer. I recommend making a /Github folder specifically to put coding projects in. 'Git clone' will make a folder that has the "magic" I just talked about. You can play with HTML, CSS or anything here, though I'd actually recommend just playing with a .txt file. Write a story or something. Not code. Practice doing 'git commit' regularly, as these are the "save-files" that save snapshots of your .txt file.

Got used to the .txt file? Begin playing with HTML, CSS, etc.

As a future developer you pretty much will end up using a command line like git bash all the time, best get used to it early.
